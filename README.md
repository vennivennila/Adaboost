Welcome to the AdaBoost implementation project! 🎯  
This notebook demonstrates how to use **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)** to build a strong classifier from multiple weak learners. The notebook is written in Python using `scikit-learn` and is ideal for learners who want to explore ensemble techniques.

## 🔍 What is AdaBoost?

**AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)** is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple "weak" classifiers (like decision stumps) to form a **strong predictive model**.

- ✅ Works for classification (and regression) problems
- 🔄 Adjusts weights on training samples to focus on hard examples
- 📈 Often improves performance on difficult datasets

## 🧠 How AdaBoost Works – Simple Steps

1. Train a weak learner (e.g., shallow decision tree)
2. Evaluate its error
3. Increase the weights of the misclassified points
4. Train the next learner more focused on those hard cases
5. Combine all weak learners into a strong final model

> "Boosting" = learning from mistakes made earlier.

## 🧪 Project Highlights

In this notebook:
- 🧹 Data is loaded and preprocessed
- 🧠 An AdaBoost classifier is trained using `sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier`
- 🧮 Model accuracy is evaluated on training and test data
- 📉 A classification report and confusion matrix are generated
- 🎨 Optional: Visualizations for understanding model performance
